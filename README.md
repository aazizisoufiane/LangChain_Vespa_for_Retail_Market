## Overview

The primary objective of this notebook is to interact with a Language Model (LLM) to inquire about a recipe. The LLM will respond with the recipe's ingredients and cooking instructions. However, the key highlight is that it will generate recommendations for each ingredient from our store using Vespa.ai, a retrieval system.

## Example

Suppose you ask the LLM for a recipe for "Spaghetti Bolognese." The LLM will not only provide you with the list of ingredients and cooking instructions but also suggest products like pasta, ground beef, tomatoes, and spices that you may need to purchase for making the dish. This recommendation is based on the available products in our store, enhancing your cooking experience.
